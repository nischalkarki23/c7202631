            		<p>
            			Few camera accessories are as versatile and necessary as a tripod. Whether you’re shooting landscape, portrait, night, street, or even wedding photography, you’re going to need a tripod at some point or another.As you progress in your photography skills, you’ll end up amassing plenty of different lens types that let you take all kinds of shots. But at the start, you’ll be better off starting with a single prime lens. (A prime lens is a lens that doesn’t zoom.)Every photographer needs flash at some point, even if you don’t intend to shoot in the dark—but don’t use the built-in flash on your camera body. It’s simply no good. Instead, spend a little bit on an external flash unit (also called a speedlight or flash gun).Dirt, dust, and moisture can get into camera bodies, lenses, and accessories—and in the worst case scenario, your expensive camera and lenses may suffer permanent damage. Neglecting camera maintenance may be the most expensive mistake you can make.

            		<p>
            			Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total.All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules. In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids.

            			 The Amur Leopard is one of the rarest felines in the world. They are speedy creatures able to run up to 35 miles per hour, faster than Usain Bolt.Amur leopards, also known as Far East leopards, Manchurian leopards or Korean leopards, are found in the Russian Far East. Their range is small and confined to forests of a temperate region crossed by the Amur River, a natural boundary between China and Russia. They are the only leopard subspecies adapted to survive in both extreme snowy winter and hot summer climates.Amur leopards have thick white or cream fur with large, widely spaced black spots called “rosettes” covering the head, back, tail and legs. Fur length varies from summer (0.7–0.9 in) to winter (2.8 in).Amur leopards are carnivores. They are opportunistic so are not fussy eaters, but prey consists mainly of roe and sika deer, hares, wild pigs and badgers. Although, when feeling brave, they have been known to eat young black bears.Food can be scarce, so if they have food left over, they may drag and hide the remains from other predators that might fancy a nibble.Amur leopards are highly territorial and live alone, only coming together to mate.

            			 since there are millions of animals living in the world’s jungles, also known as tropical rainforests. About half of all the animal species on earth—mammals, birds, insects, amphibians and reptiles—would be on that list of jungle animals.In addition, the world contains many different jungles or rain forests, and the list of jungle animals would be different for each jungle.However, if we want to, we can make a short list of some of the most interesting jungle animals in each of the rain forests around the planet. We can have a list of jungle animals for each jungle that includes a top predator or two, one or two of the largest animals in that jungle, some primates, one or more reptiles, and some birds.Animals of the various tropical rainforests around the world evolved thousands of miles from one another, and are therefore different from continent to continent and even from forest to forest. However, because all rainforest habitats are similar in many ways, many of the species in them are also similar to species from far away. For instance, all rainforests boast breathtaking numbers of bird species, and the bird species of most tropical rainforests include parrots.
